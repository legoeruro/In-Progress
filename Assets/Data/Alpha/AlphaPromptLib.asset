      action.

      updated, enter the most recent number officially assigned to you.

  - title: Identity Consistency Review Addendum
    promptText: In accordance with recent record standardization initiatives, you
      are required to re-submit your full legal name for comparison against previously

      minimizes inconsistencies that may arise from clerical variance, transcription
      errors, or unauthorized alterations. Please ensure that your entry matches
      the most current legally recognized form of your name.  Discrepancies between
      submissions may necessitate supplementary documentation, additional verification,
      or written clarification. Submission of a name differing from existing records
      may delay completion of this process and could require re-filing under amended
      identification criteria.
